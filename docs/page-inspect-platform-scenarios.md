# Platform and fault probe contract

This is the continuation of PR 123. General locator actions, multi-step parsing,
passive CDP collection and the compare command remain owned by PRs 121, 122,
124 and 125. No action parser or comparison implementation is copied here.
The existing `page_inspect.py scenario` adapter still returns
`btk-page-observe/1` through `assemble_observe`, `_section` and
`evidence_relation`. Its local page is an active, versioned **test fixture**,
not an arbitrary application probe or a real device.

## Node 24

The workspace `.nvmrc` selects major 24. With nvm, run `nvm install` followed
by `nvm use`. The existing `page_inspect.cjs` to `vendor/py_launch.cjs` bridge
requires Node 24 or newer. This change does not edit workflows, change their
existing newer Node pins, add a Node download during tests, or change permissions.
A local Node 24 runtime can execute the dependency-free fixture contract suite:

```sh
node --version
node --test tests/node-unit/page_inspect_scenario_fixture.test.mjs
```

The version reported by the executable is the runtime actually tested; a
configuration file does not establish that every CI job ran on that version.
The browserless Playwright lane also executes these tests with its configured
Node version. Real CLI browser checks run in the existing Python browser lane.

## Exact origin and reversible faults

Every HTTP request must match the initial fixture's **scheme, literal loopback
address and explicit port**. Another localhost service is not in scope, even
when it also uses 127.0.0.1. Redirects and WebSockets are blocked, and service
workers are disabled. This is a controlled browser test, not an OS-level
network sandbox; it makes no claim about WebRTC or other host processes.

For `offline`, `http-error` and `latency`, one browser session now measures:

```
baseline (online) -> fault (offline / HTTP 503 / delay) -> recovery (online)
```

A `recovered` boolean is backed by a new successful request, not merely by a
call to `set_offline(False)`. Each probe has an incrementing completion token,
so the previous phase's DOM attribute cannot be reused as fresh evidence.
`phases` and `verdict` distinguish a captured mismatch from a passing scenario.
The route guard rejects browser-offline traffic as well, since interception
and APIRequestContext fetches are not an OS network switch.

The `network` section contains only HTTP errors and failed requests. Each
entry has a fixed safe path category, status (`null` for transport failure)
and phase. Capture starts before navigation and ends after the last fixture
probe. It does not claim that no events could occur after this window. Exactly
30 events is complete; a 31st marks `truncated`, records the omitted count and
omits the digest. A frozen result cannot be mutated by later callbacks.
`evidence_relation` returns `unknown` for truncated or unavailable coverage.

The requested delay and a stable boolean are in the section. Actual elapsed
milliseconds live under top-level `measurements`, outside section digests;
clock jitter therefore does not manufacture a semantic difference.

## Permissions: baseline, requested, reset

Notification and geolocation permissions are queried **separately** with the
fixture's Permissions API. No permission prompt is requested and no position,
camera image or microphone data is acquired. The previous fixture's side
effect of requesting a geolocation result while checking notifications is gone.

The evidence records `states.baseline`, `states.configured`, `states.reset`,
`matches_requested` and `reset_matches_baseline`. `clear` restores browser
defaults; it is not synonymous with `deny`. A failed grant is a `mismatch`, not
a pass. Unsupported permission queries have unavailable coverage, null match
fields and no digest. Unexpected driver or fixture errors fail the command
rather than being relabeled as unsupported.

Geolocation grant and reset are asserted on real engines in the browser tests;
Chromium is required to provide the capability, not silently skipped. Other
engines must either pass or explicitly return unavailable evidence. This does
not replace Windows/macOS runs: all recorded OS values are actual host values,
not a label inferred from a device profile.

## Files, metadata and environment equality

Upload still uses a fixed 5-byte in-memory file; the test now removes the
selection and verifies `cleared`. Download checks completion and the fixed
fixture name, then calls `delete` on the browser-owned temporary artifact.
The browser may create temporary download bytes, but the tool does not read,
export or persist those bytes to a caller-selected host path.

The page must declare the expected fixture version. State attributes are
allowlisted; missing or arbitrary values fail without being echoed. Locale
and timezone readbacks report only the requested known value or a difference
marker. Raw exception messages, query strings, arbitrary file paths, form
values and secret attributes are not emitted.

`environment_settings` now includes actual host OS, browser version, channel,
headless mode and device profile in its digest, in addition to display settings.
Thus section comparison cannot imply identical environments merely because
the viewport matches. This does not modify the generic compare command.

Exit zero and top-level `ok` mean evidence collection succeeded. They do not
mean every observed platform expectation matched; inspect `coverage`,
`verdict` and match fields. Passive `observe` remains separate and untouched.
